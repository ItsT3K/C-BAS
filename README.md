# C-BAS
### C-BAS - The C Library for BASIC-Like Code
---
C-BAS is a C library that allows BASIC-*like* code to be written in your C program. This is a project mainly made for fun and to help me make little text based programs easier.

Files
  `cbas.h`  -  The library header file
  
  `test.c`  -  The C-BAS "Demo" source file
  
  `build`   -  Simple GCC bash script for compilation
